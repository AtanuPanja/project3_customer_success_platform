## NOTE on credentials: 
> The credentials for the project are a part of the file named:  api_role_constants.dart.

> However, there exist only the variable names just to make sure no compiler errors occur, while accessing the variables in other pages.

> For security, the credentials are hidden, and have only been shared to the reviewer.

> Reviewers please replace the api_role_constants.dart file after cloning the project, with the one I have shared personally, to ensure smooth working of the project.

> Thank you.
